        ​American Culture and Language introduces students to a variety of the customs across the United States and further introduces the American Education system. This program track is ideal for students who are considering attending school in the United States.
        
        Our American Culture course is an introductory class in which students are introduced to different aspects of American culture. Topics include food, music, clothing, behavior, and American conversation. This course encourages discussion between students as they are encouraged to share their own cultures with the class as they engage with the American cultural theme of the week.</p>
